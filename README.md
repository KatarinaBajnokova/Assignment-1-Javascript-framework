Hello,

I apologize for the current state of the file and folder organization. When I started this project, React and Sass were completely new to me, so I was already happy that I could make it work. Initially, I intended to create a well-structured project, but as I progressed, I started combining components. I was hesitant to separate them later because I was worried about potential incompatibilities and breaking existing connections.

For example, I ended up styling the "view," "calendar," and "home" buttons separately on different pages—even though they share the same design—instead of creating a single reusable component. I understand now that this approach isn’t best practice.

At this stage, I’m afraid to reorganize my files and separate the components correctly, as I worry that it might break my code. In my next assignment, I plan to focus on maintaining a cleaner separation of components, variables, and pages to enhance code reusability and overall organization. Thank you for your understanding.
